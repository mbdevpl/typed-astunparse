The *typed-astunparse* is to *typed-ast* as *astunparse* is to *ast*. In short: unparsing of Python
3 abstract syntax trees (ASTs) with type comments.

Why this module was created
===========================

The built-in *ast* module can parse Python source code into AST but it can't generate source
code from the AST. The *astunparse* module (using a refactored version of an obscure
script found in official Python repository) provides code generation capability for native
Python AST.

However, both *ast* and *astunparse* modules completely ignore type comments introduced in
PEP 484. They treat them like all other comments, so when you parse the code using
:python:`compile()`, your type comments will be lost. There is no place for them in the AST, so
obviously they also cannot be unparsed.

The *typed-ast* module provides an updated AST including type comments defined in PEP 484 and
a parser for Python code that contains such comments.

Unfortunately, *typed-ast* doesn't provide any means to go from AST back to source code with type
comments. This is why module *typed-astunparse* (i.e. this one) was created: to provide unparser
for AST defined in *typed-ast*.


Usage
=====

Example of roundtrip from code through AST to code:

.. code:: python

    import typed_ast.ast3
    import typed_astunparse

    code = 'my_string = None  # type: str'
    roundtrip = typed_astunparse.unparse(typed_ast.ast3.parse(code))
    print(roundtrip)

This will print:

.. code:: python

    my_string = None  # type: str


for more examples see `<examples.ipynb>`_ notebook.



Installation
============

For simplest installation use :bash:`pip`:

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install typed-astunparse

You can also build your own version:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/mbdevpl/typed-astunparse
    cd typed-astunparse
    pip3 install -U test_requirements.txt
    python3 -m unittest  # make sure the tests pass
    python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
    pip3 install dist/*.whl


Requirements
------------

Python version 3.5 or later.

Python libraries as specified in `<requirements.txt>`_.

Building and running tests additionally requires packages listed in `<test_requirements.txt>`_.

Tested on Linux, OS X and Windows.
